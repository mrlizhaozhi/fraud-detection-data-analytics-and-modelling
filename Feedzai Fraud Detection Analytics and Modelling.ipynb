    "**Background**: Fraud is a type of financial crime risk that poses threats to customers and banks. There're multiple typologies within fraud such as authorised and unauthorised digital, payment, credit card, application, scams, and lending fraud, etc. Financial institutions deploy data science capabilities in banking data to analyse fraud patterns, detect, and mitigate fraud risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application Fraud, Bank Account Opening**: refers to the deliberate submission of false, forged, or stolen information during the account opening process with the intent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Obtain financial products/services under false pretenses\n",
    "- Facilitate money laundering or other financial crimes\n",
    "- Circumvent regulatory controls and due diligence requirements\n",
    "- Create vehicles for future illicit activities\n",
    "\n",
    "(Reference: Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: This solution aims to discern patterns and detect application fraud in the form of bank account opening by applying statistical analysis, data visualisation, hypothesis testing, and machine learning techniques (Logistic Regression and XGBoost) to analyse and model bank account data. This covers the entire (iterative) life cycle from exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, hypothesis testing, feature engineering, modelling to model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenges**: Financial institutions face the following challenges in fraud detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *False positive*: Genuine customers/transactions flagged as fraudulent leading to increased investigation expenses.\n",
    "- *False negative*: Failure to detect fraudulent customers/transactions leading to financial loss and reputational damage, sometimes regulatory fines.\n",
    "- *Class imblance*: Fraud data is typically imbalanced which requires processing before modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodologies**: To answer the above research questions, *Logistic Regression* and *XGBoost* are appropriate. In a regulated environment like banking, explainability is critical from model governance perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Logistic Regression* is a surpervised learning method that is highly transparent. This dataset has a binary label column `fraud_bool` with large quantities of numerical and categorical variables available for featuring engineering. Logistic regression is an appropriate method for predicting fraud.\n",
    "- *XGBoost*: \n"

However, given the data definitions, -1 denote missing values rather than illegitimate inputs. These variables can be indicators of fraudulent behaviour as fraudsters may frequently change addresses.\n",

    "- There're additional columns such as `session_length_in_minutes` and `device_distinct_emails_8w`, although not highlighted in the data definitions, should not have negative numbers. These findings merit further exploration. Can be an indicator of unusual activity if the session is too long in length.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name_email_similarity` has a minimum of 0.000001 which represents a significant variance between the account owner's name and email address which may indicate impersonation risk.\n",

    "- Negative `credit_risk_score` is a high risk indicator which can be new customers or synthetic identities. The minimum is -170. Accounts with low `credit_risk_score` merit further exploration. Unusually large `proposed_credit_limit` should be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Invalid `phone_home_valid` and `phone_mobile_valid` leading to difficulty with contacting customers can be indicators of risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `customer_age` has a maximum of 90. It's worthwhile to consider the possibility of elderly abuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `device_fraud_count` seems to have 0's across all observations and have little contributing value to predictive modelling. This variable can be dropped from the data set to save compute resources.\n"
